# Webhook Integration for Payment Gateway

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of webhook functionality for the Payment Gateway application, focusing on receiving and processing Authorize.Net webhook notifications for payment and subscription events.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Entity Layer
- **WebhookEvent**: Entity for storing webhook event data
  - Stores event metadata, payload, signature, and processing status
  - Tracks related IDs (payment, subscription, customer)
  - Maintains processing state for retry mechanism

### 2. Repository Layer
- **WebhookEventRepository**: Repository for webhook data persistence
  - Methods for checking for duplicate events
  - Methods for retrieving unprocessed events for retry

### 3. Service Layer
- **WebhookService**: Interface for webhook processing
  - Validates webhook signatures
  - Ensures idempotent processing
  - Handles asynchronous event processing
- **WebhookProcessor**: Interface for event-specific processing
  - Payment event processing
  - Refund event processing
  - Subscription event processing

### 4. Controller Layer
- **WebhookController**: REST endpoints for webhook notifications
  - Main endpoint for Authorize.Net notifications
  - Health check endpoint for webhook verification

### 5. Configuration
- **AsyncConfig**: Configuration for asynchronous processing
  - Thread pool for webhook processing
  - Scheduled tasks for retry mechanism

### 6. Database Migration
- Added webhook_events table and indexes

## Security Features
1. **Signature Verification**
   - HMAC SHA-512 signature verification
   - Configurable signature key
   - Optional verification based on configuration

2. **Correlation IDs**
   - All webhook processing is tracked with correlation IDs
   - Enables end-to-end tracing of webhook events

## Asynchronous Processing
1. **@Async Processing**
   - Webhooks are processed in background threads
   - Configurable thread pool

2. **Retry Mechanism**
   - Failed events are retried automatically
   - Configurable retry count and interval

3. **Idempotency**
   - Duplicate events are detected and ignored
   - Based on unique event IDs from Authorize.Net

## Testing
1. **Sample Webhook Payloads**
   - Payment webhook example
   - Subscription webhook example

2. **Unit Tests**
   - Controller tests for webhook endpoints
   - Service tests for webhook processing

3. **Test Scripts**
   - Bash script for testing webhook endpoints
   - Instructions for verifying webhook processing

## Documentation
1. **Implementation Guide**
   - Detailed explanation of webhook architecture
   - Configuration instructions
   - Testing guidelines

2. **API Documentation**
   - Webhook endpoint specifications
   - Request/response examples

## Next Steps
1. **Production Readiness**
   - Enhanced error handling
   - Improved logging
   - Message queue integration

2. **Additional Features**
   - Webhook delivery notifications
   - Admin interface for webhook monitoring
   - Webhook replay functionality
