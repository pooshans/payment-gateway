# Payment Gateway Integration with Authorize.Net

This project implements a robust payment gateway backend application that integrates with the Authorize.Net Sandbox API. The application provides a comprehensive set of payment processing capabilities including purchases, authorizations, captures, cancellations, refunds, and recurring billing.

## Features

- **Complete Payment Processing**: Support for one-time payments, authorize+capture flow, voids, and refunds
- **Recurring Billing**: Create and manage subscription-based recurring payments
- **Webhook Support**: Receive and process payment notifications
- **Idempotency**: Prevent duplicate payment processing
- **Distributed Tracing**: Track requests across services for better monitoring and debugging
- **Correlation IDs**: All requests include correlation IDs for tracking and logging
- **High Test Coverage**: Unit test coverage â‰¥80%
- **Containerized**: Ready to deploy with Docker and Docker Compose

## API Documentation

For detailed API documentation including all endpoints, request/response formats, and example curl commands, see [API.md](API.md).

## Tech Stack

- Java 17 with Spring Boot 3.2.4
- Spring Data JPA for database operations
- Spring Security for authentication and authorization
- PostgreSQL for production and H2 for development
- Micrometer for metrics and distributed tracing
- Zipkin for trace visualization
- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Docker and Docker Compose for containerization
- JUnit and Mockito for testing
- JaCoCo for test coverage reporting

## Prerequisites

- Java 17 or later
- Maven 3.8+ (or use the included Maven wrapper)
- Docker and Docker Compose (for containerized deployment)
- Authorize.Net Sandbox account (for API credentials)

## Quick Start

### Local Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/payment-gateway.git
   cd payment-gateway
   ```

2. Configure Authorize.Net API credentials:
   ```
   Edit src/main/resources/application.yml and update the authorize.api section with your sandbox credentials
   ```

3. Build and run the application:
   ```
   ./mvnw clean install
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

4. The application will be available at http://localhost:8080/api

### Docker Deployment

The application is fully containerized and can be run with Docker and Docker Compose, which sets up:
- The payment gateway application
- A MySQL database for persistent storage
- Redis for caching and session management
- Proper networking between services

1. Set up environment variables for sensitive data:
   ```bash
   export AUTHORIZE_API_LOGIN_ID=your_login_id
   export AUTHORIZE_API_TRANSACTION_KEY=your_transaction_key
   export JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   export AUTHORIZE_API_ENVIRONMENT=SANDBOX  # or PRODUCTION
   ```

2. Build and start the Docker containers:
   ```bash
   # Build the images
   docker-compose build
   
   # Start all services
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. Monitor the application startup:
   ```bash
   # View application logs
   docker-compose logs -f payment-gateway-app
   
   # Check application health
   curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
   ```

4. Stop the containers when done:
   ```bash
   # Stop all services
   docker-compose down
   
   # To remove volumes as well (will delete persistent data)
   docker-compose down -v
   ```

#### Environment-Specific Configuration

The application supports different environments with specific configurations:
- `application.yml` - Base configuration
- `application-dev.yml` - Development environment settings
- `application-test.yml` - Testing environment settings
- `application-prod.yml` - Production environment settings
- `application-docker.yml` - Docker environment settings

To specify the environment when running Docker:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

4. Manage the deployment:
   ```bash
   # Stop all services
   docker-compose down
   
   # Stop and remove volumes (this will delete persistent data)
   docker-compose down -v
   
   # Restart a specific service
   docker-compose restart payment-gateway-app
   ```

5. Access the services:
   - Payment Gateway API: http://localhost:8080/api
   - Zipkin (distributed tracing): http://localhost:9411
   - Prometheus (metrics): http://localhost:9090
   
6. Run in different environments:
   ```bash
   # Development environment
   SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=dev docker-compose up -d
   
   # Production environment
   SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. The application and related services will be available at:
   - Payment Gateway API: http://localhost:8080/api
   - Zipkin (Tracing): http://localhost:9411
   - Prometheus (Metrics): http://localhost:9090
   - PostgreSQL: localhost:5432

## API Endpoints

| HTTP Method | Endpoint | Description |
|-------------|----------|-------------|
| POST | /api/payments | Process a one-time payment |
| POST | /api/payments/authorize | Authorize a payment |
| POST | /api/payments/capture/{transactionId} | Capture a previously authorized payment |

| POST | /api/payments/refund | Refund a settled transaction |
| POST | /api/payments/recurring | Create a recurring payment subscription |
| GET  | /api/payments/{transactionId} | Get payment details |

## Testing

Run the tests with:
```
./mvnw test
```

Generate a test coverage report with:
```
./mvnw verify
```

The coverage report will be available in the `target/site/jacoco` directory.
