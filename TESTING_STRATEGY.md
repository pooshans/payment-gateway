# Testing Strategy for Payment Gateway

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Payment Gateway application, which integrates with Authorize.NET for payment processing.

## 1. Testing Goals

The main goals of our testing strategy are:

- Ensure the correctness of all payment operations (processing, authorizations, captures, refunds, voids)
- Verify proper handling of webhook events from Authorize.NET
- Validate subscription management functionality
- Confirm data persistence and retrieval works correctly
- Ensure adequate security measures are in place
- Maintain code quality with high test coverage (minimum 80%)

## 2. Types of Tests

### 2.1. Unit Tests

Unit tests verify the behavior of individual components in isolation, with dependencies mocked or stubbed.

**Key Areas for Unit Testing:**
- Service implementations
- Repository operations
- Utility methods
- DTO validation
- Exception handling

**Frameworks/Libraries:**
- JUnit 5
- Mockito
- AssertJ

### 2.2. Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that different components work together as expected.

**Key Areas for Integration Testing:**
- Repository interactions with the database
- Service interactions with repositories
- Controller interactions with services
- External API client interactions

**Frameworks/Libraries:**
- Spring Boot Test
- TestContainers (for PostgreSQL testing)
- H2 in-memory database

### 2.3. API Tests

API tests verify the behavior of REST endpoints from an external client perspective.

**Key Areas for API Testing:**
- Request/response structure
- Status codes
- Error handling
- Authentication and authorization

**Frameworks/Libraries:**
- Spring MockMvc
- REST Assured (for external API testing)

## 3. Test Data Strategy

### 3.1. Test Data for Unit Tests
- Mock data created in test classes
- Static test fixtures for commonly used objects

### 3.2. Test Data for Integration Tests
- H2 in-memory database for quick tests
- TestContainers for PostgreSQL integration tests
- Database initialization scripts with Flyway

### 3.3. Test Fixtures
- Sample credit card numbers for different card types
- Sample webhook event payloads
- Various payment scenarios (successful, declined, error)

## 4. Test Coverage

We aim for:
- Minimum 80% code coverage overall
- 90%+ coverage for critical payment processing code
- 85%+ coverage for webhook handling code
- 80%+ coverage for subscription management code

**Measurement Tool:**
- JaCoCo for coverage reporting and enforcement

## 5. Testing Specific Components

### 5.1. Payment Service Testing
- Test successful payment processing
- Test authorization and separate capture
- Test refund processing
- Test void operations
- Test error handling and declined payments
- Test idempotency key functionality

### 5.2. Webhook Processing Testing
- Test webhook signature validation
- Test different types of webhook events
- Test duplicate event handling
- Test asynchronous processing
- Test retry mechanisms for failed events

### 5.3. Subscription Management Testing
- Test subscription creation
- Test recurring billing
- Test subscription updates
- Test subscription cancellation
- Test handling of failed payments

### 5.4. Security Testing
- Test authentication mechanisms
- Test authorization rules
- Test input validation
- Test sensitive data handling

## 6. Test Environments

### 6.1. Development
- Local H2 database
- Mocked Authorize.NET responses

### 6.2. CI/CD Pipeline
- TestContainers for PostgreSQL
- Mocked Authorize.NET responses
- Automated test execution on every commit

### 6.3. Staging
- PostgreSQL database
- Authorize.NET sandbox environment
- Manual and automated testing

## 7. Testing Practices

### 7.1. TDD Approach
- Write tests before implementing features
- Red-Green-Refactor cycle

### 7.2. Code Reviews
- Ensure tests are included in all pull requests
- Review test quality and coverage

### 7.3. Continuous Integration
- Run tests automatically on each commit
- Reject code that doesn't meet coverage thresholds
- Generate coverage reports

## 8. Test Monitoring and Reporting

### 8.1. Coverage Reports
- Generate JaCoCo reports after test runs
- Store historical coverage data

### 8.2. Test Result Reporting
- Track test success/failure over time
- Notify team of test failures

## 9. Maintenance

- Regular review and update of test cases
- Refactor tests when production code is refactored
- Remove obsolete tests
- Keep test fixtures updated

## 10. Responsibilities

- Developers: Write unit and integration tests for their code
- QA: Design and execute additional test scenarios
- DevOps: Ensure CI/CD pipeline includes proper test execution
- Team Lead: Review test coverage and quality
