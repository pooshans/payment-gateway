### Metrics Implementation

The application uses the following technologies for metrics collection and reporting:

   - Dimensional metrics with tags for detailed analysis
   - Support for multiple monitoring systems

2. **Prometheus**: Time-series database for metrics storage
   - Endpoint exposed at `/actuator/prometheus`
   - Data scraping configured at 15-second intervals

3. **Grafana**: Visualization and dashboarding
   - Pre-configured dashboards for business and system metrics
   - Alert thresholds for critical metrics

### Key Dashboards

1. **Business Overview Dashboard**
   - Transaction volume and success rates
   - Revenue metrics and trends
   - Subscription growth and churn

2. **System Health Dashboard**
   - API latency and error rates
   - External dependency health
   - Resource utilization

3. **SLA Monitoring Dashboard**
   - Service-level agreement tracking
   - Availability metrics
   - Error budgets

## Logging

### Logging Strategy

The application implements a structured logging approach with the following characteristics:

1. **Log Levels**
   - `ERROR`: Critical errors that prevent functionality
   - `WARN`: Non-critical issues that might indicate problems
   - `INFO`: Important business events and application lifecycle
   - `DEBUG`: Detailed information for troubleshooting (not enabled in production)
   - `TRACE`: Very detailed information (for development only)

2. **Structured Logging Format**
   - JSON-formatted logs for machine parseability
   - Consistent field names across all log entries
   - Timestamp in ISO-8601 format with millisecond precision

3. **Standard Log Fields**
   - `timestamp`: When the event occurred
   - `level`: Log level
   - `thread`: Thread name
   - `logger`: Logger name
   - `message`: Log message
   - `exception`: Full stack trace (if applicable)
   - `correlationId`: Request correlation ID for tracing
   - `userId`: User ID (when authenticated)
   - `requestId`: Unique request identifier

### Key Logging Events

1. **Business Events**
   - Transaction created/updated
   - Payment processed (success/failure)
   - Subscription lifecycle changes
   - Webhook events received and processed

2. **System Events**
   - Application startup/shutdown
   - Configuration changes
   - External API interactions
   - Background job execution

3. **Security Events**
   - Authentication attempts
   - Authorization failures
   - Suspicious activity detection

### Log Management

1. **Log Aggregation**
   - ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
   - Log shipping via Logstash
   - Retention period: 90 days online, 1 year archived

2. **Log Searching and Analysis**
   - Kibana dashboards for log visualization
   - Saved searches for common issues
   - Anomaly detection for unusual patterns

## Distributed Tracing

### Tracing Implementation

The application implements distributed tracing using:

1. **Spring Cloud Sleuth**: For trace instrumentation
   - Automatic trace context propagation
   - Integration with common frameworks and libraries

2. **Zipkin**: For trace collection and visualization
   - Sampling rate configured at 10% in production
   - 100% sampling for error cases

### Trace Propagation

1. **HTTP Headers**
   - `X-B3-TraceId`: Overall trace identifier
   - `X-B3-SpanId`: Identifier for current operation
   - `X-B3-ParentSpanId`: Identifier for parent operation
   - `X-B3-Sampled`: Sampling decision

2. **Context Propagation**
   - Across thread boundaries
   - Between synchronous and asynchronous operations
   - Across service boundaries

### Key Spans Captured

1. **API Endpoints**
   - HTTP request details
   - Query parameters (with sensitive data redacted)
   - Response code and timing

2. **External Service Calls**
   - Authorize.Net API requests
   - Request and response details (with sensitive data redacted)

   - Query execution time
   - Result counts

4. **Cache Operations**
   - Cache hits and misses

   - Timing information

5. **Background Jobs**
   - Job type and parameters
   - Execution time
   - Success/failure status

### Trace Sampling Strategy

1. **Base Sampling Rate**: 10% of all requests
2. **Error Sampling**: 100% of failed requests
3. **Important Transactions**: 100% of payment operations
4. **Health Checks**: 1% sampling to reduce noise

## Alerting Strategy

### Alert Categories

1. **Business Alerts**
   - High transaction failure rate (>5% in 5 minutes)
   - Unusual refund volume (>10% increase over baseline)
   - Subscription cancellation spike

2. **System Performance Alerts**
   - API latency above thresholds (p99 > 2s)
   - Database connection pool saturation (>80%)
   - High error rates (>1% of requests)

   - Increased latency from Authorize.Net
   - Database replication lag >10s

4. **Capacity Alerts**

   - Memory usage >85% for 5 minutes
   - Disk space <15% free

### Alert Channels
