8. Health check endpoint
9. JaCoCo for code coverage

You can now compile and test this basic setup. If everything compiles successfully, you're ready to move to implementing the core payment flows.

Would you like me to continue with implementing the core payment flows, or would you like to make any adjustments to the current setup?

## Project Design Journey

**prompt**
Now that we have the basic setup, let's implement the core payment flows. I need to create the following API endpoints:

1. POST /api/payments/purchase (auth + capture in one step)
2. POST /api/payments/authorize (authorization only) 
3. POST /api/payments/capture/{transactionId} (capture authorized payment)
4. POST /api/payments/cancel/{transactionId} (void before settlement)
5. POST /api/payments/refund/{transactionId} (full refund)
6. POST /api/payments/partial-refund/{transactionId} (partial refund)

Also, I need proper DTO classes, error handling, and entity persistence for these transactions.

**GitHub Copilot:**
I'll help you implement the core payment flows with Authorize.Net integration. Let's start by creating the necessary DTOs, entities, service interfaces, and controller classes.

- Proper logging with correlation IDs
- Integration with Authorize.Net SDK

You can now compile this code and test the endpoints. The implementation is ready to handle basic payment flows through the Authorize.Net sandbox. The next steps would be to implement the remaining service methods (void, refund, getTransactionDetails) and add comprehensive unit tests.

**prompt**
Now I need to implement the recurring billing/subscription features. I need the following API endpoints:

1. POST /api/subscriptions/create
2. GET /api/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}
3. PUT /api/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/cancel
4. GET /api/subscriptions/customer/{customerId}

Also, we need to create the necessary entities, DTOs, and service implementations for subscription management.

**GitHub Copilot:**
I'll help you implement the recurring billing and subscription management functionality. Let's start by creating the necessary DTOs, entities, and services for this feature.

First, let's create the DTO for subscription requests:

[Code block removed for brevity]

Now, let's create the response DTO for subscriptions:

[Code block removed for brevity]

Next, let's create the entity classes for subscriptions:

[Code block removed for brevity]

[Code block removed for brevity]

Now, let's create the repository interface:

[Code block removed for brevity]

Let's implement the subscription service interface:

[Code block removed for brevity]

Now let's implement the subscription service:

[Code block removed for brevity]

Now, let's create the subscription controller:

[Code block removed for brevity]

This implementation provides all the required recurring billing/subscription functionality:

1. Creating subscriptions with Authorize.Net ARB
2. Retrieving subscription details
3. Canceling subscriptions
4. Listing customer subscriptions with optional status filtering

The code includes:
- DTOs for request/response handling
- Entity classes for subscription and transaction data
- Repository for data access
- Service layer implementing the subscription operations
- Controller for API endpoints
- Exception handling
- Proper logging with correlation IDs

The subscription functionality supports various billing intervals (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly), trial periods, and customer information management. You can now compile this code and test the subscription endpoints with the Authorize.Net sandbox.

**prompt**
Now I need to implement webhook handling for Authorize.Net. I need an endpoint that can receive webhook notifications and process them asynchronously. The endpoint should:

1. Validate webhook authenticity
2. Process different event types (payment, refund, subscription)
3. Be idempotent to handle duplicate notifications
4. Update database records based on webhook data

Can you help me implement this?

**GitHub Copilot:**
I'll help you implement webhook handling for Authorize.Net notifications. We'll create an endpoint to receive webhooks, validate them, and process the events asynchronously with idempotency.

First, let's create a model to store webhook events:

[Code block removed for brevity]

Next, let's create a repository for webhook events:

[Code block removed for brevity]

Now, let's create DTOs for webhook requests and responses:

[Code block removed for brevity]

[Code block removed for brevity]

Let's create a service to process webhooks:

[Code block removed for brevity]

Now, let's implement the WebhookProcessor:

[Code block removed for brevity]

Now, let's create a webhook exception class:

[Code block removed for brevity]

Finally, let's create the webhook controller:

[Code block removed for brevity]

Now, let's enable async processing in our application. Add the following configuration class:

[Code block removed for brevity]

This webhook implementation includes:

1. **Webhook Receipt and Validation**:
   - An endpoint to receive Authorize.Net webhooks
   - Signature validation for security
   - Health check endpoint for monitoring

2. **Idempotent Processing**:
   - Checks for duplicate webhooks based on notification ID
   - Stores webhook events in the database with status tracking

3. **Asynchronous Processing**:
   - Uses Spring's @Async annotation to process events in the background
   - Prevents blocking the HTTP response

4. **Event Type Handling**:
   - Specialized processing for payment, refund, and subscription events
   - Updates relevant database records based on event data

5. **Error Handling and Retry Tracking**:
   - Records errors and retry counts for each webhook
   - Provides a foundation for implementing retry logic

The webhook processor is designed to be extensible, allowing you to easily add support for new event types as needed. The code also includes proper logging and correlation ID tracking for observability.

You can now compile and test this implementation with the Authorize.Net sandbox webhooks.

Is there anything specific you'd like me to explain or modify about this implementation?

**prompt**
Now I need to implement distributed tracing and observability features. I want to:

1. Implement proper correlation ID propagation
2. Add metrics for payment operations
3. Create health checks and readiness probes
4. Add structured logging for better visibility

Can you help me implement these observability features?

**GitHub Copilot:**
I'll help you implement distributed tracing and observability features to enhance your payment gateway application. Let's start by implementing each component step by step.

First, let's update the application.yml file to configure the necessary settings for metrics, tracing, and logging:

[Code block removed for brevity]

Now, let's create a more robust correlation ID filter that injects it into the MDC context and propagates it through services:

[Code block removed for brevity]

Now, let's create a configuration class for metrics and tracing:

[Code block removed for brevity]

Let's create a service for tracking metrics:

[Code block removed for brevity]

Let's create custom health indicators for critical components:

[Code block removed for brevity]

Now, let's update the PaymentServiceImpl class to use our metrics service and improve logging:

[Code block removed for brevity]

Similarly, update the WebhookProcessorImpl class to use metrics:

[Code block removed for brevity]

Finally, let's create a logging utility class to help with structured logging:

[Code block removed for brevity]

Let's also create a global controller advice to handle correlation IDs in all responses:

[Code block removed for brevity]

These implementations provide comprehensive observability features for your payment gateway:

1. **Distributed Tracing**:
   - Correlation ID generation, propagation, and logging
   - Request ID tracking for idempotency
   - Integration with Spring's MDC for logging context

2. **Metrics**:
   - Payment metrics: attempts, success, failure rates, and processing times
   - Subscription metrics: creation, cancellation, and processing times
   - Webhook metrics: received, processed, failed events, and processing times
   - Custom metrics for business insights like payment amounts and active subscriptions

3. **Health Checks**:
   - Custom health indicator for Authorize.Net connectivity
   - Comprehensive health endpoint with detailed status information
   - Readiness probes for Kubernetes/container environments

4. **Structured Logging**:
   - Enhanced logging patterns with correlation ID included
   - Contextual logging utility for consistent log formats
   - Different log levels for appropriate visibility

5. **Response Enhancement**:
   - Automatic inclusion of correlation ID in all API responses
   - Consistent error format with tracing information

This implementation will give you excellent visibility into your payment gateway's operations, making it easier to troubleshoot issues, monitor performance, and understand user behavior. You can now compile and test these features in your application.
